                <strong>Tartan Literary & Arts Magazine Issue 67</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="content-3">
                <p>This is the third (and my personal favorite) issue of the Tartan that I worked on. And at less than 50 pages, it’s also relatively compact in its focus on quality over quantity. It brims with ideas— from layered cover that “deconstructs” as you flip through the magazine to its really graceful variations on form and color. In this issue, art becomes just as much a part of the story as the content. We tried to piece together visuals and text that shared a common theme or outlook, the result being an issue that touches on many themes like the importance of family, the crises of self-identity, and the beauty of Planet Earth.<br><br>

                    Looking back at this issue now, what I cherish most is seeing my friends’ names across all of the pages. This final issue that I worked on was, in many ways, a parting gift to all the wonderful and creative people in my live before they headed off to college.<br><br>
                    
                    A month after publication, the Tartan was awarded a Silver Crown by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, one of its highest honors bestowed, for “overall excellence.”</p>

                <p>I’m not sure how this idea popped into my head, but one day I asked my staff to share their favorite Pantone color. I took all of the colors submitted and displayed it next to the staff credits, a really fun tribute to all the different backgrounds and perspectives that informed the creation of the magazine (if you’ve poked around long enough on this website my favorite color shouldn’t be too surprising).<br><br>

                    I also scanned a copy of one of the promotional posters that I had made to promote submissions, I think it’s really fun to see with all the crumples and approvals and what-not.
